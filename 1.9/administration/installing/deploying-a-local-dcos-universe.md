You can install and run DC/OS services on a datacenter without internet access with a local [Universe](https://github.com/mesosphere/universe). You can install a local Universe that includes the default packages (easiest), or select your own set of local Universe packages (advanced).

**Prerequisites:** 

- [DC/OS CLI installed](/1.9/usage/cli/install/).

- Logged into the DC/OS CLI via `dcos auth login`. On Enterprise DC/OS, you must be logged in as a user with the `dcos:superuser` permission.

**Note:** As the Universe tarball is over two gigabytes in size it may take some time to download it to your local drive and upload it to each master.

# <a name="default"></a>Installing the default Universe packages

1. From a terminal prompt, use the following cURL commands to download the local Universe and its service definitions onto your local drive.

     ```bash
     $ curl -v https://downloads.mesosphere.com/universe/public/local-universe.tar.gz -o local-universe.tar.gz
     $ curl -v https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mesosphere/universe/version-2.x/local/dcos-local-universe-http.service -o dcos-local-universe-http.service
     $ curl -v https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mesosphere/universe/version-2.x/local/dcos-local-universe-registry.service -o dcos-local-universe-registry.service
     ```

2. Use [secure copy](https://linux.die.net/man/1/scp) to transfer the Universe and registry files to a master node. Replace `<master-IP>` with the public IP address of a master before issuing the following commands.
     **Tip:** You can find the public IP address of a master in the top left corner of the DC/OS web interface.

     ```bash
     $ scp local-universe.tar.gz core@<master-IP>:~
     $ scp dcos-local-universe-http.service core@<master-IP>:~
     $ scp dcos-local-universe-registry.service core@<master-IP>:~
     ```
   
3. [SSH](/1.9/administration/access-node/sshcluster/) into the master using the following command. Replace `<master-IP>` with the IP address used in the previous commands.

     ```bash
     $ ssh -A core@<master-IP> 
     ```
     
4. Confirm that the files were successfully copied.

     ```
     $ ls
     ```
     
5. You should see the following files listed.

     ```
     dcos-local-universe-http.service  dcos-local-universe-registry.service  local-universe.tar.gz
     ```

6. Move the registry files into the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory.

     ```
     $ sudo mv dcos-local-universe-registry.service /etc/systemd/system/
     $ sudo mv dcos-local-universe-http.service /etc/systemd/system/
     ```
     
7. Confirm that the files were successfully copied into `/etc/systemd/system/`.

     ```bash
     $ ls -la /etc/systemd/system/
     ```

8. Load the Universe into the local Docker instance.

     ```bash
     $ docker load < local-universe.tar.gz
     ```
     
     **Tip:** This may take some time to complete.
     
9. Restart the Docker daemon.

     ```bash
     $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
     ```
     
10. Start the `dcos-local-universe-http` and `dcos-local-universe-registry` services.

     ```bash
     $ sudo systemctl start dcos-local-universe-http
     $ sudo systemctl start dcos-local-universe-registry
     ```
     
11. Use the following commands to confirm that the services are now up and running.

     ```bash
     $ sudo systemctl status dcos-local-universe-http
     $ sudo systemctl status dcos-local-universe-registry
     ```

12. If you only have one master, skip to step 25. If you have multiple masters, continue to the next step.

13. Use the following command to discover the private IP addresses of all of your masters. Identify the private IP address of the master you are SSHed into right now from the list.

     **Tip:** It will match the path shown after `core@ip-` in your prompt, where the hyphens become periods. 

     ```
     $ host master.mesos
     ```
     
14. Use [secure copy](https://linux.die.net/man/1/scp) to transfer the Universe and registry files to one of the other masters. Replace `<master-IP>` with the IP address of the other master. 

     ```bash
     $ scp local-universe.tar.gz core@<master-IP>:~
     $ scp /etc/systemd/system/dcos-local-universe-registry.service core@<master-IP>:~
     $ scp /etc/systemd/system/dcos-local-universe-http.service core@<master-IP>:~
     ```
     
15. [SSH](/1.9/administration/access-node/sshcluster/) into the master that you just copied these files to.

     ```bash
     $ ssh -A core@<master_IP>
     ```
     
16. Confirm that the files were successfully copied.

     ```
     $ ls
     ```
     
17. You should see the following files listed.

     ```
     dcos-local-universe-http.service  dcos-local-universe-registry.service  local-universe.tar.gz
     ```

18. Move the registry files into the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory.

     ```
     $ sudo mv dcos-local-universe-registry.service /etc/systemd/system/
     $ sudo mv dcos-local-universe-http.service /etc/systemd/system/
     ```
     
19. Confirm that the files were successfully copied into `/etc/systemd/system/`.

     ```bash
     $ ls -la /etc/systemd/system/
     ```

20. Load the Universe into the local Docker instance.

     ```
     $ docker load < local-universe.tar.gz
     ```
     
     **Tip:** This may take some time to complete.
     
21. Restart the Docker daemon.

     ```bash
     $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
     ```
     
22. Start the `dcos-local-universe-http` and `dcos-local-universe-registry` services.

     ```bash
     $ sudo systemctl start dcos-local-universe-http
     $ sudo systemctl start dcos-local-universe-registry
     ```
     
23. Use the following commands to confirm that the services are now up and running.

     ```bash
     $ sudo systemctl status dcos-local-universe-http
     $ sudo systemctl status dcos-local-universe-registry
     ```

24. Repeat steps 14 through 23 until you have completed this procedure for all of your masters. Then continue to the next step.

25. Close the SSH session by typing `exit` or open a new terminal prompt tab.
     **Tip:** You may have to exit more than one SSH session if you have multiple masters.

26. (Optional) Use the following command to remove the references to the default Universe from your cluster. If you want to leave the default Universe in place and just add the local Universe as an additional repository, you can skip to the next step.

     ```bash
     $ dcos package repo remove Universe
     ```
     
     **Tip:** You can also remove the references to the default Universe repository from **Settings** > **Repositories** in the DC/OS web interface.
     
27. Use the following command to add a reference to the new local Universes that you added to each master.

     ```bash
     $ dcos package repo add local-universe http://master.mesos:8082/repo
     ```

28. [SSH into one of your agent nodes.](/1.9/administration/access-node/sshcluster/)

     ```bash
     $ dcos node ssh --master-proxy --mesos-id=<mesos-id>
     ```
     
29. Use the following commands to download a copy of the DC/OS certificate locally and set it as trusted.

     ```bash
     $ sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/master.mesos:5000
     $ sudo curl -o /etc/docker/certs.d/master.mesos:5000/ca.crt http://master.mesos:8082/certs/domain.crt
     $ sudo systemctl restart docker
     ```
     
30. Close the SSH session by typing `exit` or open a new terminal prompt tab. Repeat steps 28 and 29 on each agent node.

31. To verify your success, log into the DC/OS web interface and open the **Packages** > **Packages** tab. You should see a list of selected packages. Go ahead and try to install one of the packages. 



### FAQ

*   **I can't install CLI subcommands**

    Packages are hosted at `master.mesos:8082`. If you cannot resolve or connect to `master.mesos:8082` from your DC/OS CLI install, you cannot install CLI subcommands. If you can connect to port 8082 on your masters, add the IP for one of the masters to `/etc/hosts`.

*   **The images are broken**

    All Universe components are hosted inside of your cluster, including the images. The components are served up by `master.mesos:8082`. If you have connectivity to that IP, you can add it to `/etc/hosts` and get the images working.

*   **I don't see the package I was looking for**

    By default, only the `selected` packages are bundled. If you'd like to get something else, use the build your own [instructions][4].

# <a name="build"></a>Installing a selected set of Universe packages

**Prerequisite:** [Git](https://git-scm.com/). On Unix/Linux, see these <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" target="_blank">installation instructions</a>.

To install your own set of packages you must build a customized local Universe Docker image.

1.  Clone the Universe repository:

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/mesosphere/universe.git --branch version-3.x
    ```

2.  Build the `universe-base` image:

    ```bash
    $ cd universe/docker/local-universe/
    $ sudo make base
    ```

3.  Inside the `Makefile` replace `--selected` flag with the comma-separated list of selected packages preceeded by `--include` flag. To minimize the container size and download time, you can select only what you need. If you do not modify the `Makefile`, all *selected* Universe packages will be included. To view which packages are selected, click on the **Universe** tab in the DC/OS web interface. 

    ```bash
    $ sed -i -e 's/--selected/--include="marathon-lb,zeppelin"/' Makefile
    ```

4.  Build `mesosphere/universe` image and compress it to the `local-universe.tar.gz` file:

    ```bash
    $ sudo make local-universe
    ```

5.  Perform all of the steps as described in [Installing the default Universe packages][5] section, except step 27. Replace the command in step 27 with the following.

    ```bash
    $ dcos package repo add local-universe http://master.mesos:8082/repo
    ```
