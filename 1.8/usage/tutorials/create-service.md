#  DC/OS Services

You can run DC/OS services you create or install a package from the [Universe package repository](/docs/1.8/usage/webinterface/#-a-name-universe-a-universe). Both services you create and those you install from Universe appear on the **Services** tab of the DC/OS web interface when they are running.

Services you create yourself are administered by Marathon and can be configured and run [from the DC/OS CLI](/docs/1.8/usage/cli/command-reference/) with `dcos marathon` subcommands (eg `dcos marathon app add myapp.json`) or via the DC/OS web interface.

# Universe Package Repository
Packaged DC/OS services created by Mesosphere or the community, like Spark or Kafka, appear on the **Universe** tab of the DC/OS web interface, or you can search for a package from [the DC/OS CLI](/docs/1.8/usage/cli/command-reference/). You can configure and run Universe services from the DC/OS web interface or via the DC/OS CLI with the `dcos package install <package-name>` command. Visit the [Managing Services](/docs/1.8/usage/managing-services/) section to learn more about installing, configuring, and uninstalling services in Universe.

# Create and Run Your Own DC/OS Service
In this tutorial, we'll go over creating a simple one-command service and a containerized service using both the DC/OS web interface and the CLI.

### Prerequisites
- A DC/OS cluster
- DC/OS CLI installed

## Create and Run a Simple Service from the DC/OS Web Interface

1. Click the **Services** tab of the DC/OS web interface, then click the **Deploy Service**.
1. Enter a name for your service in the **ID** field. In the **Command** field, enter `sleep 10`.
1. Click **Deploy**.

1. That's it! Click the name of your service in the **Services** view to see it running and monitor health.

## Create and Run a Simple Service from the DC/OS CLI

1. Create a JSON file called `my-app-cli.json` with the following contents:

    ```json
    {
      "id": "/my-app-cli",
      "cmd": "sleep 10",
      "instances": 1,
      "cpus": 1,
      "mem": 128,
      "disk": 0,
      "gpus": 0,
      "backoffSeconds": 1,
      "backoffFactor": 1.15,
      "maxLaunchDelaySeconds": 3600,
      "upgradeStrategy": {
        "minimumHealthCapacity": 1,
        "maximumOverCapacity": 1
      },
      "portDefinitions": [
        {
          "protocol": "tcp",
          "port": 10000
        }
      ],
      "requirePorts": false
    }
    ```

1. Run the service with the following commandt.
    ```bash
    dcos marathon app add my-app.json
    ```

1. Run the following command to verify that your service is running:
    ```bash
    $ dcos marathon app list
    ```
    You can also click the name of your service in the **Services** view of the DC/OS web interface to see it running and monitor health.

## Create and Run a Containerized Service from the DC/OS Web Interface

1. Go to the `hello-dcos` page of the [Mesosphere Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/mesosphere/hello-dcos/tags/) and note down the latest image tag.
1. Click the **Services** tab of the DC/OS web interface, then click the **Deploy Service**.
1. Enter a name for your service in the **ID** field.
1. Click the **Container Settings** tab and enter the following in the **Container Image** field: `mesosphere/hello-dcos:<image-tag>`. Replace `<image-tag>` with the tag you copied in step 1.

![Containerized service in the DC/OS UI](/docs/1.8/usage/tutorials/img/deploy-container-ui.png)

1. Click **Deploy**.
1. In the **Services** tab, click the name of your service, then choose on of the task instances. Click **Logs**, then toggle to the **Output (stdout)** view to see the output of the service.

## Create and Run a Containerized Service from the DC/OS CLI

1. Go to the `hello-dcos` page of the [Mesosphere Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/mesosphere/hello-dcos/tags/) and note down the latest image tag.
1. Create a JSON file called `hello-dcos-cli.json` with the following contents. Replace `<image-tag>` in the `docker:image` field with the tag you copied in step 1.
    ```
    {
      "id": "/hello-dcos-cli",
      "instances": 1,
      "cpus": 1,
      "mem": 128,
      "disk": 0,
      "gpus": 0,
      "backoffSeconds": 1,
      "backoffFactor": 1.15,
      "maxLaunchDelaySeconds": 3600,
      "container": {
        "docker": {
          "image": "mesosphere/hello-dcos:<image-tag>",
          "forcePullImage": false,
          "privileged": false,
          "network": "HOST"
        }
      },
      "upgradeStrategy": {
        "minimumHealthCapacity": 1,
        "maximumOverCapacity": 1
      },
      "portDefinitions": [
        {
          "protocol": "tcp",
          "port": 10001
        }
      ],
      "requirePorts": false
    }
    ```
1. Run the service with the following command.
    ```bash
    dcos marathon app hello-dcos-cli.json
    ```
1. Run the following command to verify that your service is running:
    ```bash
    $ dcos marathon app list
    ```
1. In the **Services** tab of the DC/OS web interface, click the name of your service, then choose on of the task instances. Click **Logs**, then toggle to the **Output (stdout)** view to see the output of the service.

# Scale Your Service

### Scale Your Service from the DC/OS Web Interface

1. From the **Services** tab of the DC/OS CLI, put your cursor over the name of the service you want to scale to reveal a gear symbol.
1. Click the gear symbol and choose **Scale**.
1. Enter the number of instances you would like, then click **Scale Service**.
1. Click the name of your service to see the number of instances you specified.

### Scale Your Service from the DC/OS CLI

1. Enter the following command from the CLI:
    ```bash
    $ dcos marathon app update <app-id> instances=<number_of_desired_instances>
    ```
1. Enter the following command to see information about your services. The `TASKS` column will show the number of instances you specified.
    ```bash
    $ dcos marathon app list
    ```
